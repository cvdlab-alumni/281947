#Generate the 2D profile curves of the car envelope in the three coordinate directions, 
#embed them in 3D (in the x=0, y=0 and z=0 planes, respectively, with the reference frame 
#origin set approximately at the car centroid) and mount them together in a "two-and-a-half-dimensional" 
#(2.5D) or "pseudo-3D" model.
